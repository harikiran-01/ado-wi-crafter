# ado-wi-crafter
This tool helps to craft work items by fetching: 1) static data from api response of existing ADO work item template(designed specifically for providing a skeletal structure for the new work items). 2) dynamic data from a data source. Current setup utilises excel as a data source with each row containing the additional dynamic data needed for the new work items.
